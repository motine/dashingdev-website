dashingDev is a card deck designed to inspire, improve and remind developers.
Each card summarizes a core concept in software development.
The deck is for people from all kinds of backgrounds and all levels of skill.
The cards are not specific to any technology – they describe the fundamentals of software design & development.

Beginners get inspiration on what to learn next; more advanced developers have the chance to expand their horizons with new concepts and seasoned developers get reminded of facts they once knew.

<p>dashingDev is neither a comprehensive teaching tool nor a full checklist for validating your design. The dashingDev cards inspire and awaken curiosity.</p>

<h1>Story</h1>
<p>My name is Tom. Over the past 25 years, I have learned a lot about software design and programming – but I have also forgotten a lot of it. Despite working in development every day, it is sometimes hard to recall everything I once knew.</p>
<p>This frustrated me, so I wanted something that would remind me and reinforce what I had already learned. If I have a little bit of time in between meetings, I want to use it to brush up on my knowledge. Also, when I get stuck with a tough problem, I want to be able to quickly get ideas to move forward.</p>
<p>I needed a quick way to recall everything that is in my toolbox to solve problems. Or sometimes when I am not quite happy with the way a solution looks, I want to flick through guidelines on how to improve my design.</p>
<p>I did not want to go though pages and pages in books, I needed something short and to the point. So, I started collecting key concepts and principles I had found helpful in the past. I made them as brief as possible and put them on little cards. This is how dashingDev came about.</p>
